Green Tea creme brulee is a must!
It has great sushi and even better service.
Not the biggest portions but adequate.
The owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint.
The staff is pretty friendly.
The prices are outrageous, especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood Chinese establishments.
Nice ambience, but highly overrated place.
Furthermore, while the fish is unquestionably fresh, rolls tend to be inexplicably bland.
On a recent trip, our waiter was extremely dismissive, while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby.
The sashimi was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted.
The only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side.
Food was fine, with a some little-tastier-than-normal salsa.
The food was great, the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me.
Mama Mia â€“ I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place.
Endless fun, awesome music, great staff!!!
Great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks.
